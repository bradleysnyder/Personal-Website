    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      Hi, I’m Brad — a seasoned product and technical leader with 10+ years of experience 
      building large-scale e-commerce, infrastructure, and enterprise SaaS products. 
      I’ve led global teams across engineering, product, and operations to deliver 
      scalable platforms, optimize performance, and drive meaningful business outcomes.
    </p>

    <p>
      My career spans product management, technical program leadership, and cloud-first 
      architecture — including scaling infrastructure for millions of daily users, driving 
      multi-year transformation initiatives, and guiding cross-functional teams toward 
      clarity, alignment, and high-impact execution.
    </p>

    <p>
      I thrive at the intersection of technology, strategy, and people — creating systems, 
      teams, and products that empower organizations to move faster and smarter.
    </p>
