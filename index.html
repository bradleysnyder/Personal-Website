      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        Hi, I’m Brad — a seasoned product and technical leader with 10+ years of experience 
        building large-scale e-commerce, infrastructure, and enterprise SaaS products. 
        I’ve led global teams across engineering, product, and operations to deliver 
        scalable platforms, optimize performance, and drive meaningful business outcomes.
      </p>

      <p>
        My career spans product management, technical program leadership, and cloud-first 
        architecture — including scaling infrastructure for millions of daily users, driving 
        multi-year transformation initiatives, and guiding cross-functional teams toward 
        clarity, alignment, and high-impact execution.
      </p>

      <p>
        I thrive at the intersection of technology, strategy, and people — creating systems, 
        teams, and products that empower organizations to move faster and smarter.
      </p>
